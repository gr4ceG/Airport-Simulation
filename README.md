# Airport
This program simulates the processes of an airport control tower: managing flight landing and takeoff. 

`arrivals.txt` and `takeoffs.txt` contain flights that, respectively, arrive and take off immediately upon program launch. Text files can be edited to include or exclude initial arrivals and/or takeoffs. 

## Setup and Instructions
Go to `releases` and download the lastest release. Unzip the zip file, and then execute the `jar` file.

Or, with an installed Java IDE: 
- Clone this repository
- Then run `src/my/airportSim -> AirportFrame.java`
